# OpenPeon — llms.txt

> An open standard for coding event sounds. Any IDE, any pack, one format.

OpenPeon is the home of CESP (Coding Event Sound Pack Specification), an open standard that defines how sound packs respond to events in agentic IDEs like Claude Code, Cursor, and OpenAI Codex.

## What is CESP?

CESP (Coding Event Sound Pack Specification) v1.0 defines:
1. A set of event categories that coding tools emit
2. A manifest format (openpeon.json) mapping categories to sound files
3. Directory structure and audio file constraints
4. An IDE mapping contract for how tools map their events to CESP categories

## Event Categories

CESP defines 9 event categories (6 core + 3 extended).

### Core Categories (players MUST support)
- session.start — Session or workspace opens
- task.acknowledge — Tool accepted work, is processing
- task.complete — Work finished successfully
- task.error — Something failed
- input.required — Blocked, waiting for user input or approval
- resource.limit — Rate, token, or quota limit hit

### Extended Categories (optional)
- user.spam — User sending commands too fast
- session.end — Session closes gracefully
- task.progress — Long task still running

## Manifest Format (openpeon.json)

Every pack includes an openpeon.json file at its root.

### Required Fields
- cesp_version: "1.0"
- name: Machine-readable ID (a-z0-9, hyphens, underscores, 1-64 chars)
- display_name: Human-readable name (1-128 chars)
- version: Semantic version (e.g. "1.0.0")
- categories: Object mapping category names to { sounds: [{ file, label, sha256 }] }

### Recommended Fields
- author: { name, github }
- license: SPDX identifier (e.g. "MIT", "CC-BY-NC-4.0")
- language: BCP 47 tag (e.g. "en", "es", "ru")
- description: Short description (max 256 chars)

### Sound Entry Fields
- file: Relative path to audio file (forward slashes, e.g. "sounds/hello.mp3")
- label: Human-readable description of the sound
- sha256: SHA-256 hex digest (required for registry submission)

### Example Manifest

```json
{
  "cesp_version": "1.0",
  "name": "my-pack",
  "display_name": "My Sound Pack",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": { "name": "yourname", "github": "yourname" },
  "license": "CC-BY-NC-4.0",
  "language": "en",
  "categories": {
    "session.start": {
      "sounds": [
        { "file": "sounds/hello.mp3", "label": "Hello!", "sha256": "abc123..." }
      ]
    },
    "task.complete": {
      "sounds": [
        { "file": "sounds/done.mp3", "label": "Done!", "sha256": "def456..." }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Directory Structure

```
my-pack/
  openpeon.json        # Required manifest
  sounds/              # Audio files
    hello.mp3
    done.mp3
  README.md            # Optional
  LICENSE              # Optional
```

## Audio Constraints

Supported formats: WAV (.wav), MP3 (.mp3), OGG Vorbis (.ogg)
Max per file: 1 MB
Max per pack: 50 MB
Filenames: [a-zA-Z0-9._-]+ only (no spaces, no Unicode)
Paths: Forward slashes, relative to manifest, no ../ traversal

## IDE Mapping Examples

Each IDE maps its own events to CESP categories:
- Claude Code: SessionStart → session.start, Stop → task.complete, Notification(permission) → input.required
- Codex: agent-turn-complete → task.complete, start → session.start
- Cursor: stop → task.complete, beforeShellExecution → task.acknowledge

## Player Behavior Requirements

- Players MUST pick a random sound from the category array
- Players SHOULD avoid repeating the last played sound
- Players MUST support a master volume control (0.0–1.0)
- Players MUST allow individual categories to be disabled
- Players SHOULD support a global mute/pause toggle
- If a category has no sounds, silently skip it

## Available Packs (36)

There are 36 CESP-compatible sound packs available at https://openpeon.com/packs covering:
- Warcraft III (Orc Peon, Human Peasant, Undead Acolyte, Brewmaster — in English, Spanish, French, Czech, Polish, Russian)
- StarCraft (Kerrigan, Battlecruiser, SCV, Firebat, Medic, Siege Tank, Science Vessel, Terran Mix)
- Command & Conquer (Red Alert 2 Kirov, Soviet Engineer, Red Alert Soviet)
- Portal (GLaDOS)
- Team Fortress 2 (Engineer)

## Registry

The OpenPeon registry at https://github.com/PeonPing/registry is how packs are discovered and installed.

- The registry index is published at https://peonping.github.io/registry/index.json
- Each entry in the registry points to an external GitHub repo (owner/repo) plus a release tag
- Players and IDEs fetch the registry index to list available packs, then download pack assets from the referenced GitHub release
- Original packs maintained by the PeonPing team live in the https://github.com/PeonPing/og-packs monorepo; community packs are hosted in their own repos

## Creating a Pack

1. Gather audio files (WAV/MP3/OGG, short clips 1-5 seconds)
2. Create your own GitHub repo with openpeon.json + sounds/ folder
3. Write manifest mapping sounds to CESP categories
4. Tag a release (e.g. git tag v1.0.0 && git push --tags)
5. Submit a PR adding your pack to registry.json at https://github.com/PeonPing/registry

## Implementing CESP in Your IDE

1. Map your IDE events to CESP categories
2. Load openpeon.json manifest from installed packs
3. On each event, pick a random sound from the matching category
4. Play the audio file, respecting volume and mute settings
